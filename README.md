# WallSlayers's Punto Steering Control
## Overview
WallSlayer's Punto Steering Drive is developed as a key component of the self-driving car project. This application enables software-level control over a Fiat Punto vehicle.

The app interfaces with custom hardware modules designed to hijack sensor data (such as steering angle, speed, and wheel encoders) and inject control commands directly into the vehicle's system. By doing so, it allows developers to bypass traditional manual input methods and programmatically manipulate the carâ€™s steering and movement in real time.
